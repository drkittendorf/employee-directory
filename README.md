## DESCRIPTION

This react website **showcases** a table of employees largely powered by the `mdbreact` package and dummy data supplied from `RANDOM USER GENERATOR` (https://randomuser.me/api/?results=200&nat=us).

With a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees renders. 

The user can:
- Sort the table by at least one category
- Filter the users by at least one property.

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## USER STORY

- As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once 
- So that I have quick access to their information.
